# A. Overview

This is a SQL Query Runner demo app. It is not connected to any backend. It's a dummy project for Front-end assessment; therefore, the results generated by this app will be the same for every case.

# B. Frameworks and Packages

It is built on React.Js with additional plugins:
1. **react-icons**: For adding icons to the app.
2. **SASS Stylesheet**: For making CSS more manageable.

# C. Page Load Time and Measurement

The current load time of this app is 0 ms on a local environment. Loading time is measured using the `performance.now()` function, called in the React `useEffect` hook.

# D. Optimization

Reduced 2ms by eliminating unnecessary hooks updates, specifically for the "limit" and "sort" hooks.
